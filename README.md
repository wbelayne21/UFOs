# UFO Sighting
## Overview of Project
  This project focuses on creating a dynamic website that displays UFO sighting information and allows users to filter sepecific data. By inserting JavaScript into an HTML page, we will display clean and organized data on the page along with a section for filtering multiple data by date, location and shape. 

### Results: 
  The webpage has a paragraph section including what current UFOlogists are saying. Below that in a table is all the data for a specific UFO sighting with date, city, state, country, shape and comment columns. The webpage also has a filter area where users can enter a location or date for a signing and the page will filter out data that is associated with the criteria. One can type multiple filter criteria for specificity or clear all the entered data and start a new search.

Above the date 1/9/2010 is entered along with the country "us". Data is filtered on the right. 

##### Summary: 
- A reset search button would be helpful instead of having users manually clear data.
- The filters under the headers would be better.
- Awkward gray space underneath the header. It might be better to move the filters there. 
- The would be more imformative had the webpage gathered images of these alleged UFO sightings.
